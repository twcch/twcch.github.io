      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still, she&amp;rsquo;s got a lot of spirit. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, what do you think? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I can&amp;rsquo;t get involved! I&amp;rsquo;ve got work to do! It&amp;rsquo;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&amp;rsquo;s such a long way from here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-care-so-what-do-you-think-of-her-han&#34;&gt;I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Your eyes can deceive you. Don&amp;rsquo;t trust them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
