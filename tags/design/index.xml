      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of this comprehensive project, I completely reimagined the user experience for EcoTracker, a mobile application platform designed for tracking environmental footprints. The challenge was to create an intuitive interface that would motivate users to adopt more sustainable lifestyle practices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Primary insights revealed that users felt overwhelmed by the complexity of tracking their environmental impact. Existing solutions were either too technical or insufficiently motivating for long-term engagement. Users expressed frustration with current market offerings but remained passionate about environmental responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Over six weeks, I interviewed 45 potential users, analyzed competitors, and studied current trends in sustainability and environmental awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I developed a structure that groups functionality into three main categories: tracking, learning, and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
